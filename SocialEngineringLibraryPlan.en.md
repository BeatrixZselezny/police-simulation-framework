# SEL ‚Äì SocialEngineering Library

Modular simulation framework for modeling manipulative and threat-based behavior in law enforcement scenarios.  
Designed for integration into the Police Simulation Game Project.

## üéØ Purpose

SEL aims to simulate behavior patterns that emerge under drug influence, psychological manipulation, or unpredictable escalation.  
The simulation provides a safe, reproducible, and audit-ready environment for tactical and psychological preparedness.

## üß© Modules

1. **Threat Pattern Database**  
   Behavior types, drug effects, locations, attacker profiles

2. **Scenario Training Engine**  
   Situational scripts, decision points, reaction metrics

3. **Emotional Debriefing Support**  
   Post-simulation analysis, PTSD risk modeling, mental health recommendations

## üß† Real-World Inspiration

SEL was inspired by a real incident where a drug-influenced attacker distracted two young officers by mimicking cat sounds, then stabbed one of them.  
The another officer later described the psychological manipulation in detail.

SEL exists to simulate such unpredictable behavior patterns ‚Äì safely, reproducibly, and without risk.
