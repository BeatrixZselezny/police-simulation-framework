# Police Simulation Game Project ‚Äì Infrastructure Simulation for Law Enforcement

This repository documents a developer-level simulation framework built with Java 21 and PostgreSQL.  
It is designed for law enforcement infrastructure modeling, not for entertainment or gameplay.  
The system simulates procedural logic, agent behavior, and threat scenarios in a controlled environment.

## üéØ Purpose

- Model law enforcement workflows and procedural logic
- Simulate threat scenarios for infrastructure testing
- Provide a reproducible backend for agent-based simulations
- Support CI/CD validation via GitHub Actions

This is not a playable game, not a public training tool, and not designed for general users.  
It is a technical framework for developers working on secure simulation logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights

- Java 21 with modular architecture
- PostgreSQL relational backend
- GitHub Actions for CI validation
- CLI-based simulation logic (no GUI)

## üß† SEL ‚Äì Social Engineering Library

This module simulates attacker behavior and influence-based threats for law enforcement scenarios.  
SEL models include:

- Drug-induced behavior
- Knife-wielding attackers
- Manipulated or unstable agents
- Escalation patterns and response logic

SEL is intended for infrastructure-level simulation, not for public training or visualization.

## üß† Real-World Inspiration

This simulation framework was inspired by a real incident involving two young police officers, where a drug-influenced attacker stabbed one officer while distracting them by mimicking cat sounds.  
The surviving officer responded with lethal force, and later described the psychological manipulation used by the attacker.

Such unpredictable, influence-driven behavior is precisely what the SEL module aims to simulate ‚Äì safely, reproducibly, and without risk.  
The goal is not entertainment, but preparedness.


## üìö Developer Context

All logic is documented for reproducibility and auditability.  
No assets, rendering, or game engine integration.  
Intended for developers modeling secure systems and procedural workflows.
