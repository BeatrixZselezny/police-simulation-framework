# 🕹️ Police Simulation Game Project

A tactical simulation game built in **modern Java (JDK 21)**, designed to model real-time decision-making in law enforcement scenarios. Originally created to practice Java development, the project has evolved into a robust, reactive system with PostgreSQL integration, automated backups, and custom AI logic.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Reactive architecture** using **RxJava** for event-driven simulation  
- **Modular design** with clean separation of logic, data, and UI  
- **Spring Framework** for dependency injection and scalable architecture  
- **PostgreSQL integration** with automated backup/restore workflows  
- **GitHub Actions** for nightly backups and error notifications  
- **Custom AI behavior** for tactical units and scenario handling  
- **Maven-based build system** for dependency management and automation  
- **Actively maintained** and continuously improved

## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

This project is not a graphical game, but a tactical simulation model designed for law enforcement training and scenario analysis. Built with RxJava and Spring, the system focuses on reactive event handling, modular decision logic, and real-time data flow. The goal is to provide a flexible framework for modeling complex operational environments without relying on visual interfaces.

## 👩‍💻 About the Developer

Hi, I'm **Beatrix Zselezny**, a self-taught developer from Budapest. I started this project to practice Java — and it grew far beyond its original scope. I believe in ethical coding, continuous learning, and leaving small but meaningful footprints in the digital world. 🐾
