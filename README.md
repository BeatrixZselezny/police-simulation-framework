# 🕹️ Police Simulation Game Project

A tactical simulation game built in **modern Java (JDK 21)**, designed to model real-time decision-making in law enforcement scenarios. Originally created to practice Java development, the project has evolved into a robust, reactive system with PostgreSQL integration, automated backups, and custom AI logic.

## 👩‍💻 About the Developer

Hi, I'm **Beatrix Zselezny**, a self-taught developer from Budapest. I started this project to practice Java — and it grew far beyond its original scope. I believe in ethical coding, continuous learning, and leaving small but meaningful footprints in the digital world. 🐾
